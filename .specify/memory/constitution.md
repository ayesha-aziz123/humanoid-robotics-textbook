# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution
<!-- Hackathon textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics -->

## Preamble
This constitution outlines the core principles, scope, structure, and guidelines for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook project. This textbook aims to bridge the gap between digital AI concepts and their practical application in physical robotics, serving as a comprehensive guide for hackathon participants, students, and enthusiasts.

## Articles

### Article 1: Purpose of the Book
**Purpose:** To create a hackathon textbook that teaches Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, effectively bridging the theoretical aspects of digital AI with the practical implementation on physical robots.

### Article 2: Scope of the Book
**Audience:** The primary audience includes hackathon participants, students, and enthusiasts in AI and Robotics.
**Modules:** The book will be structured into weekly chapters, covering Weeks 1 through 13.
**Content Types:** Content will be AI-driven, modular, and interactive, incorporating practical labs, code examples, theoretical concepts, and ethical considerations.
**Technologies:** Key technologies include Claude subagents, Docusaurus for the frontend, GitHub Pages/Vercel for deployment, a FastAPI RAG backend, Neon Postgres, Qdrant (vector database), Jetson Edge Kit for edge AI, and a Sim Rig for robotics simulation.

### Article 3: Principles of Book Creation
**AI-driven:** Content generation, personalization, and code assistance will be heavily augmented by AI.
**Modular:** Content will be organized into independent, digestible weekly chapters.
**Interactive:** The book will feature interactive labs, a RAG chatbot, and mechanisms for user feedback.
**Personalization:** The platform will support tailored learning paths and content delivery.
**Urdu Support:** Content will be available with localization for Urdu speakers.
**Open-source:** The project will adhere to open-source principles, encouraging community contributions and transparency.

### Article 4: Rules of Engagement
**Consistency:** Maintain a consistent tone, formatting, and terminology throughout the textbook.
**Accuracy:** All technical information and facts presented must be accurate and verifiable.
**Chapter Checklist:** Each chapter will follow a standardized checklist to ensure comprehensive coverage and quality.
**Version Control:** All content will be managed using Git for version control and collaborative development.
**Feedback:** A robust system for collecting and incorporating user feedback will be maintained.

### Article 5: Structure of the Book
**Front Matter:** Includes an introduction, preface, and acknowledgments.
**Weekly Chapters (Weeks 1-13):** This forms the core content, featuring theoretical explanations, practical labs, and exercises.
**Back Matter:** Comprises a glossary, index, appendices, and references.

### Article 6: Principles of Innovation
**Claude Subagents:** Utilize Claude subagents for advanced content generation, personalized learning experiences, and automated code assistance.
**Reusable Intelligence:** Develop modular AI components that can be reused across different parts of the textbook and related projects.
**Automation:** Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment, content updates, and testing.
**Sim-to-Real:** Emphasize practical application by bridging simulated robotics environments with physical hardware implementations.

### Article 7: Deployment Guidelines
**Frontend:** The textbook will be published using Docusaurus, deployed on GitHub Pages or Vercel.
**Backend:** A FastAPI-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) backend will power interactive features.
**Database:** Utilize Neon Postgres for relational data and Qdrant as a vector database for semantic search.
**Responsiveness:** The frontend will be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring responsiveness across devices.
**Authentication:** Implement user authentication for personalized content and tracking.

### Article 8: Hardware & Lab Guidance
**Sim Rig:** Provide comprehensive guidance and setup instructions for robotics simulation environments.
**Jetson Edge Kit:** Detail the use of NVIDIA Jetson Edge AI kits for practical, on-device AI implementations.
**Proxy Robots:** Offer strategies and examples for interfacing with diverse physical robot platforms using software proxies.
**Cloud/On-prem Summary:** Summarize considerations and provide guidance for deploying AI/robotics solutions in both cloud and on-premise environments.

### Article 9: Ethics & Best Practices
**IP:** Clearly define intellectual property rights, licensing, and attribution requirements.
**Privacy:** Ensure strict adherence to data privacy principles and user information protection.
**Inclusive:** Promote inclusive language, diverse examples, and accessible content.
**Safety:** Emphasize robotics safety protocols and ethical considerations in AI development.

### Article 10: Amendments & Future Proofing
**Living Document Rules:** This constitution is a living document, subject to review and amendment through a defined process to ensure its continued relevance and accuracy.
